        <project title="CAPITAL and CAPITAL Words">
            <p>From July 2013 until June of the following year, I helped develop <a href="//letr.seas.gwu.edu/projects/capital.html" target="_blank">CAPITAL: Comprehension and Pronunciation Instructional Tools for Adult Learners</a>. It is a collection of automated tutoring tools for instructors and students being developed by the <a href="//letr.seas.gwu.edu" target="_blank">Learning Technologies Research (LeTR) Group</a> at The George Washington University. The group's motivation is to tackle the adult literacy problem through the development of widely-available mobile technologies for literacy instruction and assessment. They seek to automate the generation of exercises in order to tailor exercises to the needs of every individual student. <a href="//capstone.cs.gwu.edu/2014/doku.php?id=james:start" target="_blank">CAPITAL Words</a>, my project, specifically targets illiterate and low-literacy adults, focusing on phonemic awareness and pronunciation skills as a means of improving students&#8217; reading abilities.</p>

        <project title="ManyTones">
            <p><img class="float-right" alt="ManyTones Icon" src="media/manytoneslogo.png" width="124" height="124" />In June 2013, while studying abroad at Korea University, I started developing <a href="//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamespizzurro.manytones" target="_blank">ManyTones</a>, a relatively simple Android application that automatically shuffles users&#8217; favorite ringtones, notification alerts and/or alarm sounds each time they get a phone call, receive a notification or their alarm goes off, respectively. This effectively allows users to have multiple tones of their choosing on their Android devices instead of being locked into one for each tone type. Subsequent updates also allow users to easily convert any sounds on their device into Android-compatible tones for use with ManyTones, Android&#8217;s native tone system or any other tone-related apps. While ManyTones and all its features are available for free on Google Play, an optional <a href="//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamespizzurro.manytonesdonate" target="_blank">donate version</a> is also available.</p>

        <project title="Mini-Cluster Computing Framework">
            <p>While enrolled in an <a href="//www.seas.gwu.edu/~gparmer/courses/f12_3411/index.html" target="_blank">undergraduate class in operating systems</a> at The George Washington University in the fall of 2012, two of my peers and I developed a mini-cluster computing framework for Linux as part of our final group project. It is entirely programmed in C using <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers" target="_blank">Googleâ€™s Protocol Buffers</a> and <a href="//code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/" target="_blank">third-party C bindings</a>, and while further work could be done to make it more robust, it works as intended, i.e. the framework allows users to distribute the load of command execution over other computers that share the same file system using a head-and-workers node system with a reasonable amount of built-in fault tolerance. It is available for download via this website&#8217;s Downloads page without an explicit license.</p>

        <project title="Agent Red Productions">
            <p><img class="float-right" alt="ARP Logo" src="media/agplogo.jpg" width="160" height="40" style="padding: 0 10px 10px 10px;" />From about March 2008 to August 2012, I developed and maintained various modifications of computer games built on <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)" target="_blank">the Source game engine</a> as co-founder, lead programmer and website designer/manager of the now-defunct Agent Red Productions. At its peak, ARP consisted of over twenty active developers, many of whom were managed under me. Together, we released three projects: <a href="//developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Situation_Outbreak" target="_blank">Situation Outbreak</a> (SO), <a href="//developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Lethal_Stigma" target="_blank">Lethal Stigma</a> (LS) and <a href="//developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Contingency" target="_blank">Contingency</a>. Each had its own following and was a success in its own right, but Situation Outbreak was by far our most popular modification. Gameplay videos of <a href="//www.youtube.com/results?search_query=situation+outbreak" target="_blank">SO</a>, <a href="//www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lethal+stigma" target="_blank">LS</a> and <a href="//www.youtube.com/results?search_query=contingency+hl2" target="_blank">Contingency</a> remain available for viewing on YouTube, and you can download the latest versions of each mod via this website&#8217;s Downloads page, but for a quick taste of what they&#8217;re about, here are their respective release trailers:</p>
